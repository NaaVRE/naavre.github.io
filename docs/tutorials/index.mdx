# Getting Started with NaaVRE tutorial

The aim of this tutorial is to discover the basic functionalities of NaaVRE: logging in, starting your virtual lab, and creating a workflow from a notebook:

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

This is a screencast of the tutorial:

<ReactPlayer controls width='100%' height='auto' url={tutorialVideoURL} />

## Starting NaaVRE

Open the NaaVRE demo: https://naavre.lifewatch.dev.

![Startin point](./images/1_starting_point.png)

### Signing in

Click on the 'Login' button.

![Sign in](./images/2_signin_1.png)

Chose your preferred login method:

- option 1 (recommended): Google
- option 2: Federation with EOSC (provides several options such as GitHub or ORCID)

![Sign in](./images/2_signin_2.png)

Log in with the chosen method (Google shown here)

![Sign in](./images/2_signin_3.png)

### Pick your collaborative virtual lab

On the main panel, you will see several Virtual Labs (VLs).
For this tutorial, select the 'NaaVRE Open Lab'.

![Pick VRE](./images/3_pick_vre_1.png)

When in the VL you can see:

* A description of the VL
* The instances started by other users
* A button to start your own instance of the VL
* Assets from the Virtual lab:
  * Workflow runs 
  * Data products
  * Geographical data products

![Pick VRE](./images/3_pick_vre_2.png)

### Starting your virtual lab

Click on the 'Launch my instance' button.

This opens a new tab where your virtual lab will be started. Click on the 'Sign in' button.

On the new page click on the 'Sign in' button.

![Start VRE](./images/4_start_vre_1.png)

Your virtual lab instance starts up.

### The NaaVRE interface in Jupyter Lab

You now see the NaaVRE interface in Jupyter lab.
(You can read more details [here](../NaaVRE_Interface)).

![Launcher](./images/5_naavre_interface.png)

## From notebook to workflow

### Create a notebook

Create a new Python or a R notebook by clicking on the 'Python 3' or the 'R' icon under 'Notebook' on the launcher tab.

:::note If the Launcher page is not open, click on the new tab button or 'File->New->New Launcher'.
:::


![Create notebook](./images/6_create_notebook_1.png)

Add some code to the notebook. For this tutorial, we will use a simple 'hello, world' example over two cells. The first one sets the data (in a real world application, this cell could download data from a repository), the second one prints the data (this could correspond to processing the data and generating some figures).

If you chose Python:

```python
# Input list
names = ["Alice", "Bob"]
```

```python
# Process list
for name in names:
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

If you chose R:

```R
# Input list
names = list("Alice", "Bob")
```

```R
# Process list
for (name in names) {
  print(sprintf("Hello, %s!", name))
}
```

### Containerize the cells

Open the component containerizer panel by clicking on the icon in the left-hand bar.

![Containerize cells](./images/7_containerize_1.png)

Select the first cell to containerize it.

On the left panel, you will see a preview of the containerized cell with the detected inputs, outputs, parameters and dependencies (if any).

![Containerize cells](./images/7_containerize_2.png)

Set the variable types to 'List'. For Python notebooks, type is inferred automatically.

![Containerize cells](./images/7_containerize_3.png)

Select the base image for the containerized cell ('r' or 'python' depending on your notebook).

![Containerize cells](./images/7_containerize_4.png)

Click on the 'Create' button.

:::warning
This publishes the contents of the cell to a public repository on GitHub. Do not containerize cells containing passwords, API keys, or any code you wish to keep private.
:::

![Containerize cells](./images/7_containerize_5.png)

Congratulations, you containerized your first cell!

![Containerize cells](./images/7_containerize_6.png)

Repeat the containerization cells for the second cell in the notebook.

### Compose a workflow

To compose a workflow open a new tab and click on the 'Experimenter Manager' icon.

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_1.png)

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_2.png)

Click on the 'Cells catalogue' button.

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_3.png)

For each of the cells you created:
- select the cell,
- click on Add to workspace.

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_4.png)

Drag and drop the two cells onto the canvas, as well as a 'splitter' cell.

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_5.png)

Connect the cells nodes.

:::note
It is important to note that the direction of the connections between the cells is important as it indicates the flow of ]
data dependencies between the cells. Therefore, the flow should be: 'Input list' -> 'Splitter' -> 'Process list'.
:::

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_6.png)

Click on the 'Run' button.

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_7.png)

Click on 'Execute'

:::note
If your workflow uses [parameters](../NaaVRE_Interface/#special-variables), you can set their values here. To use values from the notebook, click on 'Use notebook values'.
:::

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_8.png)

### Monitor the workflow

To check the progress of the workflow click on the link on the pop-up message.

![Experimenter Manager](./images/8_workflow_9.png)

This will take you to the workflow engine page where you can see the progress of the workflow. Click on a node to see its status and logs.

![Workflow Engine](./images/9_argo_1.png)

:::note
The first time you open the workflow engine, select the 'single sign-on' login, and close the welcome message.
